# Send a message

You can use GOV.UK Notify to send text messages, emails or letters.

## Send a text message

### Method

```ruby
smsresponse = client.send_sms(
  phone_number: "+447900900123",
  template_id: "f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a",
)
```

### Arguments

#### phone_number (required)

The phone number of the text message recipient. This can be a UK or international number. For example:

```ruby
phone_number:"+447900900123"
```

#### template_id (required)

To find the template ID:
1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. In the top left corner of the page, check you’re viewing the correct service. If not, select __Switch service__ in the top right corner of the page and select the relevant service.
1. Go to the __Templates__ page and select the relevant template.
1. Look for the template ID at the bottom of the page. For example:

```ruby
template_id:"f33517ff-2a88-4f6e-b855-c550268ce08a"
```

#### personalisation (optional)

If a template has placeholder fields for personalised information such as name or reference number, you must provide their values in a hash. For example:

```ruby
personalisation: {
  name: "John Smith",
  ID: "300241",
}
```

You can leave out this argument if a template does not have any placeholder fields for personalised information.

#### reference (optional)

A unique identifier you can create if necessary. This reference identifies a single unique notification or a batch of notifications. It must not contain any personal information such as name or postal address. For example:

```ruby
reference: "your_reference_string"
```

You can leave out this argument if you do not have a reference.

#### sms_sender_id (optional)

A unique identifier of the sender of the text message notification. You can find this information on the __Text Message sender__ settings page:

1. [Sign in to GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/sign-in).
1. In the top left corner of the page, check you’re viewing the correct service. If not, select __Switch service__ in the top right corner of the page and select the relevant service.
1. Go to the __Settings__ page.
1. In the __Text Messages__ section, select __Manage__ on the __Text Message sender__ row.

You can then either:

  - copy the sender ID that you want to use and paste it into the method
  - select __Change__ to change the default sender that the service uses, and select __Save__


For example:

```ruby
sms_sender_id: "8e222534-7f05-4972-86e3-17c5d9f894e2"
```

You can leave out this argument if your service only has one text message sender, or if you want to use the default sender.

### Response

If the request to the client is successful, the client returns a `Notifications::Client:ResponseNotification` object. In the example shown in the [Method section](#method), the object is named `smsresponse`.

You can then call different methods on this object:

|Method|Information|Type|
|:---|:---|:---|
|`smsresponse.id`|Notification UUID|String|
|`smsresponse.reference`|`reference` argument|String|
|`smsresponse.content`|- `body`: Message body sent to the recipient<br>- `from_number`: SMS sender number of your service|Hash|
|`smsresponse.template`|Contains the `id`, `version` and `uri` of the template|Hash|
|`smsresponse.uri`|Notification URL|String|

If you are using the [test API key](#test), all your messages come back with a `delivered` status.

All messages sent using the [team and whitelist](#team-and-whitelist) or [live](#live) keys appear on your GOV.UK Notify dashboard.

### Error codes

## Send a file by email

Send files without the need for email attachments.

This is an invitation-only feature. [Contact the GOV.UK Notify team](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/support/ask-question-give-feedback) to enable this function for your service.

To send a file by email, add a placeholder field to the template then upload a file. The placeholder field will contain a secure link to download the file.

The links are unique and unguessable. GOV.UK Notify cannot access or decrypt your file.

### Add a placeholder field to the template

1. Select __Edit__.
1. Add a placeholder field to the email template using double brackets. For example:

"Download your file at: ((link_to_document))"

### Upload your file

The file you upload must be a PDF file smaller than 2MB.

1. Pass the file object as an argument to the `Notifications.prepare_upload` helper method.
1. Pass the result into the personalisation argument.

For example:

```ruby
File.open("file.pdf", "rb") do |f|
    ...
    personalisation: {
      first_name: "Amala",
      application_date: "2018-01-01",
      link_to_document: Notifications.prepare_upload(f),
    }
end
```

## Get the status of multiple messages

This API call returns one page of up to 250 messages and statuses. You can get either the most recent messages, or get older messages by specifying a particular notification ID in the `older_than` argument.

You can only get messages that are 7 days old or newer.

### Method

```ruby
args = {
  template_type: 'sms',
  status: 'failed',
  reference: 'your_reference_string'
  older_than: 'e194efd1-c34d-49c9-9915-e4267e01e92e'
}
response = client.get_notifications(args)
```

You can leave out the `older_than` argument to get the 250 most recent messages.

To get older messages, pass the ID of an older notification into the `older_than` argument. This returns the next 250 oldest messages from the specified notification ID.

### Arguments

You can leave out these arguments to ignore these filters.

|`response.id`|Notification UUID|String|
|`response.reference`| String supplied in `reference` argument|String|
